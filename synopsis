# The Lord of the Rings Synopsis

## Overview
"The Lord of the Rings" is a fantasy novel originally published in three parts (1954–55) by J.R.R. Tolkien[^1^][1]. It tells the story of the hobbit Frodo Baggins and the Ring of Invisibility[^1^][1]. The novel has been highly influential and was adapted into three highly acclaimed films in 2001–03[^1^][1].

## Plot
The story begins with a summary of the prehistory of the ring of power. Long ago, twenty rings existed: three for elves, seven for dwarves, nine for men, and one made by the Dark Lord Sauron, in Mordor, which would rule all the others[^2^][2]. Sauron poured all his evil and his will to dominate into this ring[^2^][2].

An alliance of elves and humans resisted Sauron’s ring and fought against Mordor[^2^][2]. They won the battle and the ring fell to Isildur, the son of the king of Gondor[^2^][2]. But just as he was about to destroy the ring in Mount Doom, he changed his mind and held on to it for himself[^2^][2]. Later he was killed, and the ring fell to the bottom of the sea[^2^][2].

The creature Gollum discovered it and brought it to his cave[^2^][2]. Then he lost it to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins[^2^][2]. The movie cuts to an image of the hobbits’ peaceful Shire years later, where the wizard Gandalf has come to celebrate Bilbo’s 111th birthday[^2^][2].

In the middle of a rambling speech, Bilbo puts on the ring, which makes him invisible, and runs to his house to pack his things and leave the Shire[^2^][2]. Gandalf meets Bilbo back in his house and tells him he must give up the ring[^2^][2]. Eventually Bilbo agrees to entrust it to his nephew Frodo[^2^][2].

Gandalf senses that the ring is gaining power over Bilbo[^2^][2]. We see a flash of Mordor, and hooded horsemen, the ringwraiths, leave its gates[^2^][2]. The scene shifts to Gandalf, who rushes to a library to sift through ancient scrolls[^2^][2].

As the ringwraiths begin to close in on Bilbo’s house, Gandalf returns to Frodo and throws the ring into Bilbo’s hearth[^2^][2]. Mysterious letters appear on the ring’s surface[^2^][2]. Only then does Gandalf realize that this ring is actually Sauron’s ring[^2^][2].

Gandalf explains to Frodo that the ring and Sauron are one[^2^][2]. He longs to find it, and it longs to find him[^2^][2]. Gandalf has learned that Sauron has kidnapped Gollum and that Gollum has revealed that Bilbo has the ring[^2^][2]. The ring must leave the Shire or it will endanger all the hobbits[^2^][2].

Gandalf cannot take it himself, since as a wizard he will wield too much power with the ring[^2^][2]. He determines that Frodo must take it[^2^][2]. Gandalf explains that if Frodo puts on the ring, it will draw Sauron’s agents to it[^2^][2].

Suddenly, Gandalf discovers that Frodo’s friend Sam has been hiding outside and listening to Gandalf and Frodo[^2^][2]. At first, Gandalf is furious at Sam’s eavesdropping, but then he recruits Sam to be Frodo’s travel partner and protector[^2^][2]. Sam and Frodo leave Bilbo’s house, and in very little time they have ventured further from the Shire than ever before[^2^][2].
